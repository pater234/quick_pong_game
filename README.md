## Quick Pong Game
Originally started as a quickly coded pong game for me to play whenever I was bored without any sort of difficulty, then evolved into something a bit crazier

# How to run
Literally just run pong.py and make sure pygame is installed, it's a pretty self-enclosed game of pong with a bunch of random additions that I spent too much time adding.

# Overlay Mode
The game immediately starts in overlay mode, where it opens up in the middle of your screen at high transparency. The transparency can be increased by hitting 'n' to make the window less visible and decrease by hitting 'm'. If you want to leave overlay mode hit 'o'.

# Vector Mode
Something new I came up with. The motion of the paddle effectively applies a force vector onto the motion vector of the ball, meaning if the ball is going to the top of the screen and you move your apddle upwards while hitting the ball will move faster and if you oppose the motion it will move slower.

# Crazy Mode
Randomly occurs, causes the ball to switch directions at random. Honestly have no idea why I created it, just ended up rolling with it even though its heavily unbalanced.

# Powerups
Basically my way of balancing the severely unbalanced game I created for the user in single-player versus computer games, where the user's paddle can increase for a period of time, the ball will slow down or speed up, or the computer's paddle will shrink. Otherwise with crazy mode and the obstacles and the difficulty changes it is insanely difficult to play. 

# Four Player Mode
Each player defends one side of the screen. Either two players playing against each other and two computers or one player playing against three individual computers. Golf style scoring where you want your score to be the lowest as otherwise the scoring doesn't make sense. Pretty self-explanatory.
